# tSIP-video
tSIP version with video support.

Source code from this project is now moved back to tSIP project, with the intention to build both video and "regular" binaries from the same source. Commit history from this project should be still useful though.

While video support is not mature, it looks like compile-time switch would be enough to keep it from negatively affecting basic, audio-only version.
